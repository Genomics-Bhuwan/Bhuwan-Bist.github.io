            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a PhD student in Dr. Tereza Jezkova's lab at Miami University. My research focuses on conservation genomics, phylogenomics, and molecular evolution, utilizing bioinformatics and genomic tools to explore evolutionary processes. I am passionate about studying local adaptation, species delimitation, population genomics, and range expansion, with an emphasis on understanding the mechanisms driving biological diversity.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                My goal is to understand how various interacting factors influence and drive genomic and ecological variation in organisms. To investigate these topics, I employ a range of bioinformatics techniques, including next-generation sequencing methods such as Sanger sequencing, ddRAD sequencing, and whole genome sequencing. Additionally, I utilize diverse statistical analyses, encompassing Bayesian methods, Frequentist approaches, and machine learning. By integrating these methods, I aim to develop effective measures for mammalian conservation.
